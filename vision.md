Goal: chrome extension that connects to (via login) chatgpt convo/chat of user researching a product in a chrome tab, then when user clicks on 
link suggested by llm in that chat, the chrome extension uses ai to do research on the actual currently existing products using the live/
updated/current context of that chat (and if possible of the user--if all convos are pullable/scrapable from chatgpt) to determine which actual
currently-live existing products on the site are best for the user (ex: user wants an espresso machine without plastic, heavy metals, at 
certain price point, etc)
